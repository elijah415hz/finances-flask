## Description
The most recent iteration of a months long project to get a better handle on my finances. From humble beginnings as a Google Sheet document, this project has now blossomed into a React web application with a Flask backend connected to a MySQL server hosted on Google Cloud. Created because automated finances tracking apps have never worked for me. I'm able to stick with tracking my finances much better if it's something that I need to take a slightly more active part in. I also love having the ability to fully customize how everything is categorized, and how reports are generated. Uses Pandas on the back end for creating and serving reports, and Matplotlib for creating charts. All information is currently input through a Google form that feeds in the MySQL database via some custom scripting in Google's Apps Scripts. Eventually that functionality will be handled entirely by this application, paving the way for making this project a progressive web application with offline functionality. This is still a work in progress, and is currently only connected to my personal data. Eventually I hope to open this up as an application that anyone can use to being tracking their finances. It's really helped me so far!
